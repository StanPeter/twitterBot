    Twitter Bot project

    I used this to learn more about twitter's API and this is the result. I eventually stopped as I'm not 
    as interested in Twitter(just curiosity)

    For now contains 3 main funcionalities ->
    Getting all tweets from your accounts, following people(who follow you) based on your criterias, liking tweets based on
    your criterias.




Instructions: (commands for Windows might differ)


    1. Create a new environment                                 "  python -m venv venv  " 

    2. Activate it                                              "  source venv/bin/activate  "

    3. install required libraries by executing                  "  pip install -r requirements.txt  "
    in terminal

    4. create .env file and inside set up CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET variables which
       you can find inside your twitter account in setting(exact setup might have changed so just search it up)

    5. check out the functions, there are simple and you'll for sure understand, change arguments and execute the programme


PS: Using Python3
