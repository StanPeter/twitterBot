Twitter Bot project

I used this to learn more about twitter's API and this is the result. I eventually stopped as I'm not 
as interested in Twitter(just curiosity)

For now contains 3 main funcionalities ->
Getting all tweets from your accounts, following people(who follow you) based on your criterias, liking tweets based on
your criterias.

Manual:

0. create an environment inside cloned github folder
1. activate env "source env/bin/activate" and install required modules "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. set up .env file and put there all required env variables(there are 4 :) )
3. check out the functions, there are simple and you'll for sure understand, change arguments and launch the programme
